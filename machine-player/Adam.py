# This class inherits from Agent
# Adam is a one Agent who is able to play Catan
# He is the first Agent I've created who is able to learn
# His name is inspired by the Adam optimizer, but also the story of Creation in the Bible
# Perhaps a bit clich√©, but I like it
# Adam can select any action, even if it is not legal
# He is able to learn from his mistakes
# By default, he will explore 10% of the time

# Import the Agent class
from Agent import Agent

# Import the CatanModel class
from Model import CatanModel

# Import the torch library
